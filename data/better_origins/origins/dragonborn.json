  "description": "Very rarely, when an Enderian is born, it can mutate and become a Dragonborn. They can fly and have powerful claws which allow them to climb any surfaces. They can carry mobs and players on their back, and give them a free ride. However, water is their worst enemy and they can't hold a shield because of their claws."

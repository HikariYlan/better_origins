# Guardian Princess

## Pros

- ~~Has Thorns I by default (even without armor)~~
- ~~Inflict weakness II for 2 seconds when hitting an entity~~
- ~~Can breathe/mine/see underwater (base origin)~~
- ~~Not attacked by guardians~~
- ~~Doesn't get the mining fatigue effect from the elders~~
- By right-clicking an entity with a scale in the main hand, can give some bonus effects (TBD), with a cooldown of 2 minutes

## Cons
- ~~Spawn in the overworld, in an ocean monument~~
- ~~Change the craft of the sea lantern to complicate it a bit~~
- ~~Cannot breathe on land (base origin)~~
- ~~Has blindness on land, unless the player has a sea lantern in off-hand~~
- ~~Can only eat aquatic flora (algae, sea weed, corals, sea cucumbers...)~~
- ~~Cannot wear leggings and boots, & cannot wear less than iron~~

## Neutral

- By sneak-right clicking with both hands empty, can "pull out" a scale (give a prismarine shard), with a cooldown of 30 seconds, and take damage that ignores armor
